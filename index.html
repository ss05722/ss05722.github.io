  <p style="color:purple;" >  My name is Roth and I am from Cambodia. 
	I grew up in Cambodia with my family in the capital city Phnom Penh. 
	Growing up in Cambodia was very different. We did not have A/C throughout the house. The only
	I grew up learning Cambodia and English at the same time since my mom wanted us to move to the States. 
	At the age of 9, I move to the States with my mom and my sister. 
	At first, it was very difficult for me to adapt to the new change. 
	I only knew a little bit of English during the time. 
	I had a difficult at school communicating with the teacher and the students in class. </p> 
 <p style="color:purple;" > <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">  Going to school was one of the most difficult thing to do because I did not understand most of the stuff they talk about in class.
     During lunch I would sit by myself because no one wanted to talk to me. I was a nobody to them.
	 After a few months I got better at speaking English and that is when I started to talk to people and have a better understanding of they are saying. 
	Living with my aunt and cousins also helped with improving my English skill. I make new friends and classmates by the middle of the year. 
	We would hang out during our break lunch and stay after school together to get our work done.
	Even though I make new friends I still felt like part of me was missing because something are still new to me.
	I remembered missing my best friend in Cambodia like crazy.
	Our famillies were very close friends, so since we were born we were always together.
	I remembered how upset she got when she heard that I was moving to the United States. Before I came to America, for three months we would spend everyday together because we knew we would not be able to see each other for a very long itme. 
	I did not get to see my best friend for 10 year until this year 2017. 
	I was a little nervous because we have not seen each other in so long that we might not know what to talk, but when she came we were the same old friends who talks for hours.

 <p style="color:purple;"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> Even though my English was improving it still does not feel like home.
 I remembered going to bed every night thinking about when I will be able to visit hometown.
     Cambodia was a beautiful and rich country with its culture and traditon. 
	 Many know Cambodia through the ancient templer called Angkor Wat. 
     Angkor Wat is one of the largest religious monument in the world. 
	 Each year thousands of people from different parts of the world come visit the beautiful temple. 
 The temple attracts many people coming into our country and learning about our culture and tradition.
 In our culture Buddhist is the main religion and each year we celebrate
 events such as the water festival at Angkor Wat. Water festival is known bring luck and be thankful for the goodness in life. 
 Each year people travel to Angkor Wat to celebrate the water festival to flow little flower boats, and enjoy traditional dancing as an entertainment.
